        <h1>Lubbock Coding Academy Day 2 Interview Questions</h1>
        <article>
            
            <h2>1. Describe one thing you learned in class today.</h2>
                I learned that Github is going to take some time and effort to learn correctly. I need to learn exactly why I and several other’s pages encountered 404 errors when trying to navigate to our Github pages. Beyond that I need to learn more about what Github can and can not do, as well as its extra features.
                    
            <h2>2. Describe your workflow when you create a web page.</h2>
                    
                You should first have a clear picture of what your end goal is and how your users will interact with it. To this end you should start with a wire frame or mock up. Next you should layout the HTML elements to get the building blocks in place. Next you need to start setting up your CSS to maneuver and style the HTML until the final product is obtained. Lastly you should test the features of your site and make sure everything functions in the intended way.
                    
            <h2>3. Explain what ARIA and screenreaders are, and how to make a website accessible.</h2>
                    
                ARIA(Accessibility Rich Internet Applications) is a set of HTML attributes added to certain elements, designed to make a page more accessible to those with disabilities such as blindness/deafness. Screen readers use the alt text attribute and other ARIA features to read aloud for those with visual impairment. You can make a website more accessible by using high contrast colors to ensure your text is easier to read. Captions can be used for videos to help those with audio impairment. You should include alt text to all images on the page so screen readers can access it. You can test for website’s accessibility using certain applications and websites that will ascertain how accessible your page is.
