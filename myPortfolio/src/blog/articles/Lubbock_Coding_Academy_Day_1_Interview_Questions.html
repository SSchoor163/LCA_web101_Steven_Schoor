        <h1>Lubbock Coding Academy Day 1 Interview Questions</h1>
        <article>
            
            <h2>1. Describe one thing you learned in class today.</h2>
Code wise I learned that there are a variety of ways the view port can be affected by CSS that will change the size and available space of the web page. However what I took to the most from this first day is that I am at the forefront of opportunity. That someone would move from San Antonio, a much larger city, to be here in Lubbock and take this class. I knew this would be a good opportunity for a more challenging career in a field that interested me, but it really hammered home that these next 9 months will change me, and that I really want to see what I can do when I finish this course.

<h2>2. What excites or interests you about coding?</h2>

What excites me about coding is that it is one of the hidden magics of the world. Itâ€™s something that only those that study it and know what to look for will understand what they are looking at. That coding underlies almost all areas of the modern world. From our smartphones to tanks, they all require programming for their differing parts to function and for the user to operate them.

<h2>3. What does a doctype do?</h2>

Doctype is not html code, but is a declaration required by browsers to show the primary purpose of the file being loaded. First implemented in XML and html 4.0 requiring additional information about the file, it has been simplified in html 5.0 to simply declaring the file as HTML. Simply put the doctype declaration tells the browser the file is a html document.

<h2>4. Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector.</h2>

This is where the cascade in CSS is applied. The CSS is applied from left to right top to bottom with more specific selectors overriding previous styling. The browser knowing which elements are affected using 5 categories and a few special cases. The least specific selector simply calls the element. Next are classes, attribute, pseudo classes, and pseudo elements. These will override any previous styling applied to the target elements. If it conflicts with a CSS that has equal specificity, the later selector will be applied. Next most specific is the Identity selector, it is the most powerful of the standard CSS rules, but can only be applied to one element. You can combine these various selectors to target and create specificity scores (1, 100, and 100 by their respective levels), of course the higher specificity wins out. There are a variety of special commands that influence the way CSS interacts with html. Combinators, while they do not affect specificity, they change what the selector will target in very robust ways. Then there is inline styling which is CSS applied in the html itself and is considered poor coding practice, however it will override almost all external CSS and has its proper applications. Lastly the !important applied at the end of a CSS declaration will override everything, even inline styles and can only be overwritten by another !important declaration either later in the document or one with a higher specificity.
